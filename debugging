Yes! There's a Python debugger called pdb just for doing that!

You can launch a Python program through pdb by using pdb myscript.py or python -m pdb myscript.py.

There are a few commands you can then issue, which are documented on the pdb page.

Some useful ones to remember are:

b: set a breakpoint
c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint
s: step through the code
n: to go to next line of code
l: list source code for the current file (default: 11 lines including the line being executed)
u: navigate up a stack frame
d: navigate down a stack frame
p: to print the value of an expression in the current context
If you don't want to use a command line debugger, some IDEs like Pydev have a GUI debugger.
